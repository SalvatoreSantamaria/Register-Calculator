# Register Calculator Sales Taxes

Hi, I applied for the Junior Front End Software Engineer position and this is my Sales Taxed calculator that I was tasked with building. 
This project was built in vanilla JavaScript as I am unfamiliar with C# at this time (would love to learn!). In it, I assume that input will always be entered in the correct format:
`1 {item} at {price}.`
Otherwise, some code would need to be added in order to account for these edge cases of incorrect inputs.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
